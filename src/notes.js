    title:"C",
    content:"Web-based developers will be unlikely to consider C when building a web-based application. There are three primary reasons: First, C predates the modern Internet and was never designed for web-based development. Second, C is a low-level language with verbose syntax, which doesn't lend itself to rapidly building a web-based application. Third, a popular web-based framework has never emerged for developers.",

        title:"C++",
        content:"Web developers commonly learn C++ to gain low-level control of machine resources. Although this level of control may be unnecessary for most web developers, it will prove extremely valuable for performance critical applications, such as video games.",

        title:"Java",
        content:"Web-based developers use and learn Java for many reasons, but I will highlight just two of them: mobile development and formal education. The first reason refers to Java's use for building Android-based applications. The second reason relates to Java's adoption in colleges and universities to teach computer science concepts",

        title:"C#",
        content:"Web-based developers will be inclined to use C# when building applications for devices operated on Microsoft Windows. Whether it's a mobile or desktop application, learn C# if you're targeting these users."

        title:"Javascript",
        content:"avaScript has recently become the only language capable of being used on the client-side and server-side of a web-based application. For this reason, aspiring web developers should give serious consideration to learning JavaScript. Colleges and universities offer classes in this language, but most of them lack comprehensive coverage of the language. Coding bootcamps seem to teach JavaScript in a way that's more comprehensive.",

    id:6,
        title:"PHP",
        content:"PHP is a server-side scripting language. Well-known companies, such as WordPress and Facebook, use PHP to run their web-based applications. Newer companies prefer JavaScript, Python, and Ruby for web development because of their corresponding web application frameworks. The PHP community's response has been Laravel, which is generating excitement within the PHP community.",
